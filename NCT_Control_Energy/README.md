# Control Energy Analysis

This directory contains scripts used to quantify the energetic costs of brain state dynamics using **Network Control Theory (NCT)**.

## Toolbox & Dependencies

**All control energy calculations in this study were implemented using the `nctpy` toolbox.**

* **Repository:** [https://github.com/LindenParkesLab/nctpy](https://github.com/LindenParkesLab/nctpy)
* **Reference:** Parkes, L., et al. (2024).

We adapted the functions provided in this toolbox to calculate transition energies and stability metrics based on our specific structural and functional data.
